# Learning JavaScript

This repo stores codes from me reading through [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](javascript.info) and following (most of) its tasks and other testing codes I wrote along the way.
Simpler tasks might be completed in the sandbox or skipped and not included here.

For now, the codes are categorized into folders by their corresponding chapters.
